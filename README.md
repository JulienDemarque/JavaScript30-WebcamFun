Wes Bos JavaScript30 - day 19

This is my take on Wes Bos course JavaScript30 - day 19 Webcam Fun...
It is a Photo Booth with filters (red filter, rgb split, "green" screen), you can take picture and save on your computer.

It runs in the browser from your local server (uses Browsersync).

To install, copy the files, run "npm install" then "npm start". It will open in : http://localhost:3000/
